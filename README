    `` MTest ‘‘

MTest (stands for MicroTest) is a tiny TDD framework in less than 51 lines.

It provides the Kernel#MTest method that takes an array of test as a parameter.

Need an example? Right.

  require 'mtest'
  
  tests = [
    "This is a simple test",
    ["Sum 40+2", proc {
      40 + 2
    }, 42]
  ]
  
  MTest(tests)
  
MTests returns a hash that represents the results of a test. Example!

  tests = [
    "This is a simple test",
    ["Sum 40+2", proc {
      40 + 2
    }, 42],
    "This one fails",
    ["FAIIIL", proc { true }, false]
  ]
  
  res = MTest(tests)
  
  res # => {:pass => 1, :err => 0, :fail => 1}
